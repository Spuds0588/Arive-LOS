  <div class="section"><h2>Overview</h2>The latest ARIVE LOS update (v2025.10.0.0) introduces User-Level Automations, a powerful feature designed to give individual loan officers greater control over their daily tasks and repetitive work. This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough of how to effectively use this new functionality. It covers how to access the user automations menu, the key differences between user, branch, and organization-level settings, and how updated Task Templates integrate with these new workflows. The content also explores the distinctions from admin-only automations and outlines current limitations and best practices to ensure a smooth setup.</div>
  <div class="section"><h2>Key Takeaways</h2><ul><li>User Automations in ARIVE provide loan officers with personal control over their task workflows, independent of company-wide settings.</li>
      <li>The system now has three distinct automation levels: Organization, Branch, and User, each with its own scope and permissions.</li>
      <li>Task Templates have been enhanced to work directly with User Automations, allowing for more customized and efficient workflow creation.</li>
      <li>Understanding the differences between admin-controlled (Org Level) and user-level automations is key to leveraging the feature correctly.</li>
      <li>This update is specifically aimed at helping Loan Officers, Processors, and Admins reduce manual, repetitive tasks.</li></ul></div>

  <div class="section"><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p><strong>Q: What are User Automations in the ARIVE platform?</strong><br>
      A: User Automations are a feature introduced in ARIVE v2025.10.0.0 that allows individual users, like Loan Officers, to create their own automated workflows to manage daily tasks, providing more control than traditional, company-wide automations.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: How do User Automations differ from Org-level automations in ARIVE?</strong><br>
      A: Org-level automations are set by administrators and apply to the entire organization. User-level automations are created and managed by the individual user and apply only to their personal workflow, offering greater customization and flexibility.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: Who can benefit most from using ARIVE's User Automations?</strong><br>
      A: Loan Officers, Processors, and other mortgage professionals who want to streamline their repetitive daily tasks and create a more personalized, efficient workflow inside the ARIVE loan origination system will find this feature highly beneficial.</p></div>
